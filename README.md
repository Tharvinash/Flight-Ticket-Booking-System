This project has been developed in aim to aid and computerized a flight ticket booking system. Flight ticket booking system will hold flight schedules and its fare traffic, passenger reservations and ticket reservations records. It saves time as it allows user to no longer wait in a queue to book flight tickets. 

The flight ticket booking system project has few classes that is used to complete this coding which are Ticket, Queue, LinkedList and Flight. Tester class was used to run all the other classes used in this assignment. Basically, all the processes are done in the Tester class. Tester class allows user to enter information of the customers. We used several methods to do the booking, editing the ticket information, view ticket status and to cancel the tickets.
